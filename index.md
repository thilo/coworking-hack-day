Just like last time, everyone is sincerely welcome to participate, whether by leading a project group, giving a workshop, or helping others bring their ideas to light. The [wiki](http://coworkinghackday.wikispaces.com) is the place to propose your great ideas & see what others would like to work on. Follow the [CoHackDay Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cohackday) for updates. The hashtag to use is #cohackday!


### Coworking Hack Day was a great success!

Here's the great documentary film made by Alex (<a href="http://www.twiter.com/langalex">@langalex</a>):

### About

CoHackDay is about getting together to share our ideas, think of new ones, and teach and learn from each other. Maybe you have a project of your own that you want or need help with, a suggestion for something that would make co.up better or more beautiful, or just want to come hang out to watch, learn something new, and get your hands dirty for the first time. We’re hoping for a diverse crowd with varied interests, whether that be crafting, lighting, art, hardware, photos, webstuff, arduino, making mate, or anything else you love. Everyone, no matter what their skill level might be, is invited to participate!

### Projects and RSVP

Want to join us? Submit your project now: new concepts and ideas, hardware or software to make our office or any other space cooler, modifications to lighting, furniture, space and schedule organization, etc. Whatever you can think of that would make coworking more enjoyable, this is the time to try it.

We’ll collect your submissions in our <a href="http://coworkinghackday.wikispaces.com/">wiki</a> - the place to find co-hackers or check out all planned projects if you haven’t come up with your own idea yet.

### Location

<p>The event is hosted by the <a href="http://co-up.de/" title="co.up coworking space">co.up coworking space</a>, which is right in the heart of Berlin-Kreuzberg.
