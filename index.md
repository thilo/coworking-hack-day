### About

CoHackDay is just around the corner! Let's get together to share our ideas, think of new ones, and teach and learn from each other. Maybe you have a project of your own that you want or need help with, a suggestion for something that would make co.up better or more beautiful, or just want to come hang out to watch, learn something new, and get your hands dirty for the first time. We're hoping for a diverse crowd with varied interests, whether that be crafting, lighting, art, hardware, photos, webstuff, arduino, making mate, or anything else you love. Everyone, no matter what their skill level might be, is invited to participate!

Check out our <em>schedule</em> to get an idea of what you can expect.

### Projects and RSVP

Join us and submit your idea now: new concepts and ideas, new hardware or software to make our office or any other space cooler — whatever you can think of that would make coworking more enjoyable, this is the time to try it.

We collect your submissions in our <a href="http://coworkinghackday.wikispaces.com/">wiki</a>. That’s also the place to find co-hackers, or if check out all planned projects if you haven’t come up with you own idea yet.

You can use <a>Facebook</a>, <a>Plancast</a> and <a>Lanyrd</a> to RSVP.
